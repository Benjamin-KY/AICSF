# Adaptive Intelligence Cyber Security Framework (AICSF)

Welcome to the AICSF repository! This repository contains the code and documentation for the Adaptive Intelligence Cyber Security Framework - a dynamic and adaptive framework that uses AI techniques for cyber security in SMEs.

## Components

The AICSF consists of the following components:

1. **Data Foundations**: This component emphasizes the essential role of initial data collection and preparation in the process.

2. **AI Integration Flow**: This term captures the essential process of utilizing AI and GNLP techniques to transform the collected data into actionable policies.

3. **Security Blueprint**: This emphasizes the tangible results, including the cyber security policies and measures produced by AI and GNLP.

4. **Continuous Learning Loop**: This component reflects the continual monitoring, feedback, and adjustments needed for maintaining and improving the system.

5. **Tech Infrastructure Base**: This term clearly indicates the physical and technological systems that support the implementation of AI and GNLP for cyber security.

6. **Environment Influencers**: The external factors that affect the system are easily understood as influencers coming from the environment like regulatory changes, market trends, and cultural shifts.
